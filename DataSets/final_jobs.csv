731,Business Development Manager,All-Sydney-NSW,Deliveroo,23 Apr 2019,na,Full Time,Sales,New Business Development,"Why Deliveroo? When you first think about Deliveroo, you probably think of getting great food to your house in less than half an hour.  Awesome right? But behind the scenes is the real story. This story is one of high growth, huge challenges and an enormous opportunity ahead of us. It began with our founder Will, arriving in London over 5 years ago and finding it almost impossible to order great food, despite the wealth of incredible restaurants in the city.  Fast forward 5 years and we operate in 13 countries with over 50,000 riders who deliver orders from 50,000 restaurants in over 200 cities worldwide. We want to be the definitive food company - the app you go to any time you have a hunger pang. We are transforming the way people think about food. We are providing people with limitless access to different cuisines and restaurants, turning cooking from a chore to a choice, and giving people the freedom to eat what they want, when they want, where they want it. We work with riders, restaurants and consumers. We operate one of the most complex three sided marketplaces in the world and we do this in real time. Millions of customers and thousands of restaurants and riders rely on us to match them within milliseconds. The algorithms behind that marketplace are the secret sauce that allow us to deliver our orders in under 30 minutes. And we’re just getting started The scale of the opportunity ahead of us is immense. The global food market is valued at £7.7 trillion but only 1% of it is currently online. Contrast that with the digital disruption of countless other industries - from banking and travel to retail and communications - it’s clear that our journey in the food sector has only just begun. We are already a multi-billion dollar company that is more than doubling in size every year.  Deliveroo came top in the FT’s’ list of Europe’s fastest growing 1000 companies in 2018, and we were the first company ever to win Deloitte’s ‘UK Top 50’ two years in a row. Yet most of the extraordinary value this company will generate lies ahead of us. The Role  We are looking for a field based Business Development Manager. This is a rare opportunity to become a founding and critical member of a rapidly growing, well-funded startup. You'll be liaising with Sydney's most premium and highly regarded restaurants. As a member of the local sales team, your role will include developing new relationships with restaurants as well cultivating existing ones. This is a role for an intelligent, motivated, self starter to develop their sales career for a leading company within its market sector. You will be tasked with signing up Sydney's best restaurants. More specifically, you will:  Map and target restaurants across Sydney in a very methodical and organised fashion Communicate (physical visits, email, calls, social media) with restaurants to demonstrate Deliveroo technology Sample food from a variety of high quality establishments Attend restaurant and food meet ups Requirements  You must be comfortable with targeting new business and have proven Sales Experience The job requires great communication skills whether it be face to face, through phone or email Ability to persuasively demonstrate product and industry knowledge to clients is a must Knowledge of the restaurant industry is a significant plus You will need to be tenacious and self motivated Benefits   Become one of the key employees of a fast-growing, exciting startup changing the food delivery landscape Open, respectful and fun company culture BIG Friday lunches – Deliveroo'd to the office of course! Weekly Exercise class to counteract all the amazing food! Have a real impact on the company's growth and evolution Work with people who love what they do every day Life at Deliveroo We are a growing team, with very large impact, seeking to answer some of the most interesting questions out there. We move fast, we’re always looking for new ideas and we’re very transparent about the decisions we make and why we make them. There are so many questions we need to answer and plenty more we haven’t even encountered. How do data and technology help restaurants to grow as consumer habits change? How can we predict what someone wants to order for dinner long before the idea has even crossed their mind? At Deliveroo these are just some of the tough problems we are solving - and there is no challenge that cannot be yours. No solution is owned by a particular team, which means the scope for growth and personal impact is enormous.",data-analyst,https://www.seek.com.au/job/38863358?type=standout&searchrequesttoken=f87a1376-4571-48b9-ab36-80e719270f6f,Sales & Marketing,business analyst,50000.0,Senior_level

1232,Business Development Manager,All-Melbourne-VIC,Deliveroo,23 Apr 2019,na,Full Time,Sales,New Business Development,"Why Deliveroo? When you first think about Deliveroo, you probably think of getting great food to your house in less than half an hour.  Awesome right? But behind the scenes is the real story. This story is one of high growth, huge challenges and an enormous opportunity ahead of us. It began with our founder Will, arriving in London over 5 years ago and finding it almost impossible to order great food, despite the wealth of incredible restaurants in the city.  Fast forward 5 years and we operate in 13 countries with over 50,000 riders who deliver orders from 50,000 restaurants in over 200 cities worldwide. We want to be the definitive food company - the app you go to any time you have a hunger pang. We are transforming the way people think about food. We are providing people with limitless access to different cuisines and restaurants, turning cooking from a chore to a choice, and giving people the freedom to eat what they want, when they want, where they want it. We work with riders, restaurants and consumers. We operate one of the most complex three sided marketplaces in the world and we do this in real time. Millions of customers and thousands of restaurants and riders rely on us to match them within milliseconds. The algorithms behind that marketplace are the secret sauce that allow us to deliver our orders in under 30 minutes. And we’re just getting started The scale of the opportunity ahead of us is immense. The global food market is valued at £7.7 trillion but only 1% of it is currently online. Contrast that with the digital disruption of countless other industries - from banking and travel to retail and communications - it’s clear that our journey in the food sector has only just begun. We are already a multi-billion dollar company that is more than doubling in size every year.  Deliveroo came top in the FT’s’ list of Europe’s fastest growing 1000 companies in 2018, and we were the first company ever to win Deloitte’s ‘UK Top 50’ two years in a row. Yet most of the extraordinary value this company will generate lies ahead of us. The Role  We are looking for a field based Business Development Manager. This is a rare opportunity to become a founding and critical member of a rapidly growing, well-funded startup. You'll be liaising with Melbourne's most premium and highly regarded restaurants. As a member of the local sales team, your role will include developing new relationships with restaurants as well cultivating existing ones. This is a role for an intelligent, motivated, self starter to develop their sales career for a leading company within its market sector. You will be tasked with signing up Melbourne's best restaurants. More specifically, you will:  Map and target restaurants across Melbourne in a very methodical and organised fashion Communicate (physical visits, email, calls, social media) with restaurants to demonstrate Deliveroo technology Sample food from a variety of high quality establishments Attend restaurant and food meet ups Requirements  You must be comfortable with targeting new business and have proven Sales Experience The job requires great communication skills whether it be face to face, through phone or email Ability to persuasively demonstrate product and industry knowledge to clients is a must Knowledge of the restaurant industry is a significant plus You will need to be tenacious and self motivated Benefits   Become one of the key employees of a fast-growing, exciting startup changing the food delivery landscape Open, respectful and fun company culture BIG Friday lunches – Deliveroo'd to the office of course! Weekly Exercise class to counteract all the amazing food! Have a real impact on the company's growth and evolution Work with people who love what they do every day Life at Deliveroo We are a growing team, with very large impact, seeking to answer some of the most interesting questions out there. We move fast, we’re always looking for new ideas and we’re very transparent about the decisions we make and why we make them. There are so many questions we need to answer and plenty more we haven’t even encountered. How do data and technology help restaurants to grow as consumer habits change? How can we predict what someone wants to order for dinner long before the idea has even crossed their mind? At Deliveroo these are just some of the tough problems we are solving - and there is no challenge that cannot be yours.

1243,Work-From-Home Admin Assistant/Data Entry Rockstar,All-Melbourne-VIC,E S and S J Mills,10 Apr 2019,Start at award wage $25/hr. Excel & earn more!,Part Time,Administration & Office Support,Administrative Assistants,"*****APPLICATIONS CLOSED!*****We've received over 440 email applications in the first 7 days. Thanks for your interest in the role. The Awesome Opportunity up for Grabs We’re looking for an Admin Assistant/Data Entry Rockstar with a ‘hawk-eye’ attention to detail to join our work-from-home team.   This role is all about taking the brief we give you about a new client, then digesting that information and putting it into our templated marketing material in a way that makes sense. (I’ll explain more about our system in a moment...)   There’s lots of room for growth in this role, and we’re looking for someone that wants to work with us long-term. The role will initially focus exclusively on helping us get new client marketing campaigns written (remember - it’s templated & we’ll teach you the system. You just need to be someone that LOVES attention to detail, and put the right information in the right spots. No marketing experience required).   Who We Are and What We Do You’ll be joining the copywriting arm of a fast-growing specialist dental marketing company. The company, Aligner Advantage, works with dentists and orthodontists all over Australia and the UK to help them drastically increase new patient revenue.   We specialize in helping Invisalign providers achieve the top level provider status and position them as the leading Invisalign provider in their local area.   A large focus is on the digital marketing side of things by bringing in a consistent flow of high-quality new patient Invisalign leads every single month. (This is where you will primarily be involved).   Other members of our team then work with our clients by providing front office communication training and the actual dentists and orthodontists with sales training to get the most out of their leads.   We’re also a fully remote agency! Everyone works from home.   What Will Each Day Bring? Day to day is always changing. The goalposts are always moving and we’re in a fast-paced and exciting industry.   However, to begin with, your role will focus on one primary job… onboarding new clients! So what’s involved?   Team Communication   You’ll communicate directly with the Copy Chief and the Account Manager to ensure you have all the information needed to complete the new (templated) marketing funnel for each new client we bring on.   You’ll need to regularly update us on where you’re up to and proactively communicate and ask questions if you’re stuck or missing information… we work on tight turnaround times, so clear and proactive communication is vital!       Writing The Templated Marketing Funnel   Each new dentist or orthodontist requires a templated funnel to be created. The reason we use a template is that it’s heavily tested and PROVEN to work, so it practically guarantees our clients get results as soon as they start!   Each new funnel includes: Facebook Ads, Landing Pages to collect lead information, Emails & SMS’s to follow-up with patients that submitted their information, and phone call scripts to help the front desk teams book patients in for their free consultation.   The information you’ll be inputting includes: phone numbers, dental practice name, location, a profile about the dentist, etc, as well as the specifics of what they offer in their free consultation.    Once you’re comfortable with the onboarding process, we’ll get you involved in other day-to-day ad hoc tasks that come up. This includes...   Editing Current Funnels   If our clients buy new equipment, their marketing offer may change. Small edits will need to be made, and you’ll be able to handle a lot of these ad hoc changes       Rolling Out New Tests   We’re always testing new things to improve our system. Whether it’s a set of new Facebook ads or new emails for clients, our copywriting team will create a new template for you… then you will take that template and input the details of up to 10 clients at once.    To the wrong person, this work can feel monotonous as it is all templated! But this role is vital to the success of our work. We’re a premium service and our clients invest a lot to work with us each month. So you’ll be responsible for getting their very first experience with the company right… with no errors in their campaign, ensuring our clients receive the quality service they’re expecting!   Who Are You? To be very clear, this is a junior role. You’ll be trained in how to use our system and excel at your job, but you’ll probably be a great fit if you:   LOVE admin work and take pride in getting your data entry work done quickly and to perfection… with no errors!   An interest in marketing will help you enjoy the work and grow with the company   Previous experience with tools such as Asana and Slack (preferred, not essential)   Have a ‘hawk-eye’ to spot errors before clients see it! You’ll need to proof your own work and be thorough about using the checklists we provide to get all the details correct.   Comfortable talking to teammates! We all work from home, so it’s vital that you’re comfortable reaching out to provide updates and ask questions to keep projects on track.   Be a friendly, confident and quick communicator. We’re very proud of our team culture, and we expect you to communicate in a friendly manner with everyone you’re working with.   Are comfortable working from home (hey, it’s not for everyone.)   Are assertive… yes, we encourage people to speak up and give their thoughts. We are not looking for a ‘yes’ person! If you see a mistake, TELL US :-)   ORGANIZED - No, caps-lock didn’t get stuck on, you need to be organized. We give you great freedom and flexibility. With it comes responsibility, so you need to stay organized!   Enjoy working in a fast-paced environment   Are willing and eager to learn. We encourage an environment where we’re learning every day and individually growing, both professionally and personally. Everyone on this team in time becomes a sponge... they love learning and learn to easily absorb new information on a daily basis.   Be willing to have fun! Yes, it may seem obvious, but we like to enjoy ourselves at work and more often than not the best work happens when we're all enjoying ourselves.  If we both feel you’re the right fit for the role we’ll elaborate on the bigger picture of what our business is all about.   What You Get We’re looking for a casual work-from-home Admin Assistant/Data Entry Rockstar.   Award wages to begin with ~ $25.68/hour   Room to grow when you excel at your role   Freedom to work from home every day   Starting at approximately 5 hours per week (1 new client funnel)   Looking to grow to 20 hours per week in the next few months (we’ll be onboarding 3-5 new clients every single week if our sales team hits their goals!)    How to Apply *****APPLICATIONS CLOSED!*****We've received over 440 email applications in the first 7 days.

Your mind is sharp, and you are keen to keep improving how you apply it.   You care about the accuracy of the information you provide, and you take care to ensure it’s right.  If a request is unclear, you’ll clarify it before getting stuck in. If you get asked for something that’s not the most practical, you’ll focus on understanding the problem so that you can help to come up with a better way.  You love spotting patterns and joining dots. And your natural thirst for knowledge keeps you coming back for more. If you want to join a team that will celebrate your love of learning and desire to deliver information that can help a business thrive, we’d love to meet you.   There are a few skills we’d like you to have…   An interest in the commercial aspects of a business like Bellroy (for example, understanding what drives gross profit);   Some experience with using data, including sourcing data from different systems, making sure it’s clean (or cleaning it if necessary); and a strong interest in drawing practical insights out of it.   A strong interest in communicating with people (both technical and non-technical) and a desire to be really practically useful.   Basic proficiency with SQL and programming (you don’t have to be a data scientist, a programmer or a statistician, but you probably need to have dabbled a bit in this area).   A knack for seeing which insights and pieces of information are the important ones for decision making, and an interest in designing reports that focus on the most important pieces while giving enough context to let people dive deeper if they want to.   Attention to detail.  You care about the nitty gritty of cell labelling and table naming (in a sales order, does “time” mean the time the order was placed? Fulfilled? Recorded in the database? What currency is “price” in? And so on…).  You care because you know that these little things mean that your colleagues can really quickly absorb the information you are providing, and draw appropriate conclusions from it.   An ability to think about data flows: given some messy source data, you can find a clean normalised form, and see how to extract that clean data from the messy source.    If you were already here, last week you might have…   Had a look at a draft departmental dashboard, compared it against the department’s goals and made some suggestions for how the dashboard might be improved to help the department make better informed decisions.   Fielded a couple of report requests from managers, and decided whether to:   Teach them how to answer their questions using our reporting tools;   Generate a report for them (as a one-off or a new standard report);   Visualise data using R to provide a more insightful data representation to answer their question;   Build a new model in Looker, then a report from that model, to answer the request and also provide a basis for answering future requests on the same topic;   Clarify the request into a new task for the rest of Data Team to solve, getting to the heart of decisions the report must help a person make (rather than reflect the information that person might be interested in knowing).     Reviewed the results of the last round of our internal prediction market, and:   plotted with our General Improvements Team to design the next round of questions, optimising for both the usefulness of the information we gain and how engaging (fun!) the game is for our team;   plotted with our Flourishing Team to improve the effectiveness of the activity as training for others to become better decision makers.     Created Guesstimate models, collaborating with our General Improvements Team, to:   estimate how profitable an online-only gift card program might be if we implemented it;   estimate the effectiveness of some proposed in-store point-of-sale displays;   form a template for estimating the cost of delay on our product development projects.      Why work for Bellroy? Bellroy’s mission is to inspire better ways to carry; use business as a force for good; and help the world – and our crew – flourish. We do good by making great products that delight people in their everyday lives; by innovating and testing better ways to help our staff love their work and grow as people; and by donating a portion of our revenue to some of the world’s most effective charities. We have a beautiful office space in Fitzroy (and another smaller one in Bells Beach), and we are constantly looking for better ways to do… well, everything. Want to help us?      If you’re ready to apply… This role is Full Time working with our team in Fitzroy.

1099,Data Engineer,All-Melbourne-VIC,Bellroy,15 Apr 2019,na,Full Time,Information & Communication Technology,Database Development & Administration,"IN A NUTSHELL… Help us make better decisions by getting our (many) data pipelines flowing smoothly and sensibly into a well-architected warehouse.  Bellroy loves to balance art with science; using data to inform and test our theories, and iterating towards Truth. We need your help to  build, improve and maintain the infrastructure required to extract, transform, load and enrich data from a variety of sources.  With your help we’ll be able to get the right info, infer useful things and make better decisions. Then test, and keep improving. When the warehouse is fully functional, you’ll lend your sharp logic to improve internal processes, automate systems, and optimise, well, everything.  And down the track we’d love you to get involved with some Bayesian analysis, machine learning and other interesting data team projects. If you get excited by the idea of providing the right data to inform great decisions; and you want that data to be accessible, understandable and trustworthy, then this could be the job for you. If you bring your experience, smarts and detail-oriented brain to help us, we’ll offer a world-class team to learn from, the tools you need to do your thing, and the support you need to flourish.   YOU COULD BE THE ONE, IF…  Your logic and reasoning is formidable, as is your determination. You are ordered and decisive, yet creative at the same time. You like things to end up fitting neatly in the boxes; but you don’t mind looking outside of them in the first place to find the answers. You get a kick out of getting things right, and you have the patience to do that every time. Because you present your work with pride, knowing you’ve done all you can to make sure it’s correct – and useful. Disorder makes you uncomfortable. With well ordered data in a clean schema, life is good. But you love a challenge more than most other things, so where you see inconsistency or confusion, you also see an opportunity. And you’ll follow that thread until you’re confident you’ve sorted it out.   You might have been called a “bookworm” more than once in your life, because your curiosity has you forever seeking (and absorbing) information. And nowadays, this natural thirst for knowledge has you constantly looking at ways to improve, optimize and enhance – yourself, your processes, and your data. A bit like a mechanic will with a car, you’ll break apart the whole into pieces you can check and analyse, before rebuilding an idea, process or system into something better. Sound familiar? If so, we’d love to meet you (and that brain of yours).   IF YOU WERE HERE IN THE LAST COUPLE WEEKS YOU MIGHT HAVE:  Reviewed our overall data systems (supported by very competent sysadmins) to make sure everything was in order and to look for larger scale improvements Built out a handful of new pipelines to bring more of our core business data into our data warehouse Chased a handful of data validation alerts raised by our pipelines, and taken the time to get to the root cause of each of them, then either delegated the fix to an appropriate someone else or fixed them yourself Suggested an improvement to our A/B testing infrastructure Worked outside of data team, with our developers, flexing your database and query optimisation skills to decide whether to fix a performance issue they’re having at the database level, or insist that the fix should be in the code (and, that’s fun - they’re an excellent bunch) Provided an ad-hoc analysis (working with our analysts) to someone who requested it, integrating a one-off data source Talked with our CIO about some of our mid-term plans, and how we’ll support them with data THERE ARE SOME QUALITIES YOU MUST POSSESS:  At least three years experience in data-related roles Advanced working knowledge of SQL and experience in ETL using a workflow management tool such as Apache Airflow Experience with building and optimising data pipelines Experience with collecting data from a variety of sources including APIs (good APIs, bad APIs, and ugly APIs) Strong analytical skills and an ability to perform root cause analysis Training in Computer Science, Statistics, Informatics, Information Systems or another relevant quantitative field (or demonstrable skill in one of those areas and the story of how you built that skill without formal training) Very high precision – you need to know how to verify that your work is correct Bonus points for more experience with relevant programming languages (ie. Ruby on RAILS, Python, R, Scala), PostgreSQL, project management and machine learning.   LOCATION AND HOURS This is a full-time role based in our Fitzroy office.  Start Date: We're ready when you are!   IF YOU'RE READY TO APPLY...

The time and effort that teachers put into their classes ensures the best educational outcomes for our students
which has most recently been reflected in our improved VCE Results.
We take pride in offering our students guided support throughout their chosen pathway of VCE,
VCAL or VET studies and prepare them for post-secondary options, including tertiary entry and
further training or employment. In recent years our rate of Year 12 students entering further
education, training or full time employment has been maintained at over 90%.

and enrichment programs across Years 7 to 12. These programs include international exchange

Selection Criteria








SC1    Demonstrated experience and skills in coordinating a specific education support function. 
SC2    Demonstrated capacity to supervise the work of other support staff and to develop procedures and guidelines relating to the work area. 
SC3    Demonstrated high level oral and written communication skills. 
SC4    Possess the technical knowledge and expertise relevant to the position. 
SC5    Demonstrated capacity to provide advice and support to management in respect to the work area. 
SC6    Demonstrated commitment to professional learning and growth for both self and others.







Role








Performs and/or supervises tasks that are carried out in accordance with guidelines, accepted practice and school policy.  This may include the supervision and coordination of other education support class staff within the work area or educational program.  Supervision and coordination would be limited to ensuring routine tasks are performed to required standards.  Input into identifying training needs and development of education support class staff within the work area or educational program becomes an important feature at range 2.
Specialised support to achieve specific outcomes is a feature of range 2.  Typically this will involve accountability for a single function, (e.g. ensuring data is properly maintained) or the operation of a work area (e.g. managing the day to day operation of a school office) under the direction of the principal or another senior manager.
Provides support to teachers and students that is beyond the routine support provided at education support class Level 1, range 1.  Within an educational program assists teachers with the coordination of the support function, such as directing/organising the work of other support staff or providing a specialist support role. 
Undertakes medical intervention support tasks or other specialised student/teacher support roles that require specific training that must be updated from time to time.  The role is for a specific purpose for which there will be direct accountability as opposed to support roles that are carried out by a range of staff performing routine tasks under direction.
Performs technical tasks that require a sound knowledge of basic technical and/or scientific principles that are used to develop and adapt work methods and make judgements where there are clear guidelines and limited options.  Routine technical support in libraries, science and information technology laboratories would be typical examples.
An education support class position supports the educational services being provided to students, but must not include duties of teaching as defined in clause 2.6.1 of the Education and Training Reform Act 2006 (Vic) or its successor.  Supervision of students cannot be required except where it is an integral part of the employee's position or involves supervision of students individually or in small groups, in controlled circumstances, where the responsibility for students remains clearly with a teacher.







Responsibilities








-    Provides coordination support to teachers through rostering and the organisation of the work of a team of aides, including supervision and guidance. -    Conducts routine presentations to parents to assist teachers in communicating objectives and outcomes relating to educational programs and/or students. -    Liaise with external providers of support services. -    Provide medical intervention support that involves a specific medical condition approved by the Department, requires specialised training/instruction that requires regular updating and has clearly defined responsibility for the administration of such support.







Who May Apply








Individuals with the aptitude, experience and/or qualifications to fulfill the specific requirements of the position.







EEO AND OHS Commitment








The Department values diversity and is committed to workforce diversity and equal opportunity in schools and all education workplaces. The Department recognises that the provision of family friendly, supportive, safe and harassment free workplaces is essential to high performance and promotes flexible work, diversity and safety across all schools and Department workplaces.
